                I was honored to be a National Merit Finalist and valedictorian of my high school, finishing with a GPA of 4.66, the highest possible. I was the sole candidate from my high school for the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program and placed at West Virginia Math Field Day in 2020. My academic prowess was also applied to my AP tests, being awarded AP Scholar with Distinction in 2019 and 2020. However, I knew I could not focus my energy merely in the classroom. I was proud to be elected as class representative all my years of high school and for that to culminate in Student Body President my senior year. In Cross Country, I worked my way to be Varsity Captain in both junior and senior year after running since sixth grade. 
                Each summer, being selected for and attending every West Virginia Governor's School led me to design an original product ("Caja Case"), diversify my artistic portfolio, brainstorm energy alternatives, and break down casino games mathematically. When I was not enjoying those enriching camps, I would spend my free time as a volunteer for the Ronald McDonald House Charities. Words cannot describe how my time there shifted my world view, opening mind to life's relativity.
